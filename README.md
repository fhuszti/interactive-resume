# Fran√ßois Huszti - Interactive Resume

The interactive version of my resume, made in JavaScript with Phaser.

I made this to have fun learning how to make a basic HTML5 game with a JavaScript framework.
I didn't create any of the assets used in this as I'm a terrible artist and I wanted to focus on the code. You can find all links and credits at the end of the resume.
